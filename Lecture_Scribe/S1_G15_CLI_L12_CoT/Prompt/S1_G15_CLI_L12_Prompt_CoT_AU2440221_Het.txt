Generate a lecture scribe from this lecture slides which is to be used for exam preparation. I need you to reason step by step for definitions, assumptions, derivation, theorems, examples and formulas. Reasoning with proper step by step explanation should be included in scribe for better understanding during exam revisions, and none of the reasoning should come from out of the contents of the slides. The scribe should stick to the lecture slides and should be accurate. No content should be invented or self made. Keep the content in scribe in same structure and scope as lecture slides.
