Generate a formal, academic lecture scribe suitable for exam preparation using ONLY the provided context (lecture slides / transcript / textbook excerpt). While writing the scribe, reason step by step through definitions, assumptions, theorems, proofs, derivations, and example solutions exactly as presented in the context, and include that step-by-step reasoning explicitly in the final scribe so the logical flow is clear for revision; explicitly state all definitions and assumptions, and for every proof, derivation, or worked example in the context, reproduce it in a numbered step-by-step exam style with no missing steps. Do not introduce any new material, alternative 
reasoning paths, extra examples, or external facts beyond what is explicitly contained in the provided context. Maintain a formal university-level tone optimized for exam revision, use clear headings and subheadings, and ensure every statement is traceable to the provided context. use the content in the zip file. do OCR on each slide.
